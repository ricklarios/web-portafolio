        title: "About Me",
        description: "I’m a Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience in the audiovisual industry. Currently, I specialize in developing interactive applications for television, collaborating with the networks of Mediaset Group. My tech stack is diverse, covering everything from web and iOS applications to HBBTV, microservices, and both frontend and backend development.\n \nMy career began in the media industry as a Sound Engineer, where I gained extensive experience as a director, cinematographer, and technical producer for events and television content creation. Additionally, as a musician and music producer, I’ve cultivated a holistic understanding of how different creative disciplines intersect to deliver innovative solutions.\n\nThis multidisciplinary background empowers me to bring fresh ideas and tailored solutions to a wide variety of projects. Whether it's crafting interactive user experiences or optimizing backend systems, I strive to integrate the best of both worlds: technical excellence and creative vision.\n\nThis portfolio reflects my journey as a programmer and my passion for merging storytelling with technology to create impactful experiences.",
